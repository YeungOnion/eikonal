# Eikonal_PVES
Use the Eikonal formalism from optics to evaluate experimental observables from theoretically modeled potentials with high accuracy and speed.

PREX (Lead Radius Experiment) is focused on identifying the radius of the lead nucleus. This is expected to be illuminating for nuclear physics as it should provide information on the nuclear structure of a high-Z nucleus. The outer surface of the nucleus is proposed to be only neutrons, forming a neutron skin, a region composed purely of neutrons bound by nuclear forces. Some additional understanding of neutron rich matter will allow the equation of state (EOS) to be described with narrower parameters and this EOS will also describe other neutron rich matter, like neutron stars and other high-Z nuclei.

The approach of the experiment is to use a variety of probes to gather information on lead. The probe that is best described with this Eikonal formalism is the electron probe as there isn't a decay chain as the electron will neither break the nucleus nor can it break apart. By taking the high energy limit, we can approximate the total effect of the potential on all channels of the electron's momentum with a fully distorted wave
